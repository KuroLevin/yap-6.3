 YAP 6-3.5 Manual                         {#mainpage}
====================

This file documents the YAP Prolog System version 6.3.4, a high-performance Prolog compiler developed at LIACC, Universidade do Porto. YAP is based on David H. D. Warren's WAM (Warren Abstract Machine), with several optimizations for better performance. YAP follows the Edinburgh tradition, and is largely compatible with DEC-10 Prolog, Quintus Prolog, and originally with C-Prolog.

The manual is organised as follows:

This manual was written by Vítor Santos Costa,
Luís Damas, Rogério Reis, and Rúben Azevedo. The
manual is largely based on the DECsystem-10 Prolog User's Manual by
D.L. Bowen, L. Byrd, F. C. N. Pereira, L. M. Pereira, and
D. H. D. Warren. We have  used comments from the Edinburgh Prolog
library written by R. O'Keefe. Documentation from many built-ins is
originally from the SWI-Prolog manual, with the gracious authorization
from
Jan Wielemaker. We would also like to gratefully
acknowledge the contributions from Ashwin Srinivasian.
