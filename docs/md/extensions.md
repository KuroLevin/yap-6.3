Extensions to core Prolog.			{#extensions}
=========================

YAP includes a number of extensions over the original Prolog
language. Next, we discuss how to use the most important ones.

In the description of the arguments of predicates the following
notation will be used:
	
	+ a preceding plus sign will denote an argument as an "input
argument": the argument is read, not written, and it cannot be a free
variable at the time of the call.
	
	+ a preceding minus sign will denote an "output argument";

	+ an argument with no preceding symbol can be used in both ways.
