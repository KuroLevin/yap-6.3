YAP Prolog Library                       {#LibraryPage}
===================


YAP provides a collection of Prolog utilities, that extend core Prolog
with data-structures such as balanced trees and hash tables, extend
Input Output, or use the `C`-interface to interact with the
Operating System or to implement arrays.
  
These programs are stored at the library_directory path (set by the
`LIBDIR` variable in the Makefile for YAP). 

The files have different sources. Many were part of the public-domain
Edinburgh Prolog library. Other Prolog systems such as SWI-Prolog
were kind enough to allow using files from their distributions.
